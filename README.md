# doppler-3d-scene-generator

This script allows you to convert a comp full of masked layers, into a custom 3D Scene. You can use a random or doppler analysis for z-position. In this particular example, we have a comp with a bunch of galaxies masked out, and a background layer. We can use this script to add a camera and automatically place the galaxies throughout z-space to create cool animation/paralax fx. This script also has some functionality to automatically center anchor points of any given mask.
